# Algorithms and Data structures

## Introduction to Algorithms 

- <mark> Guidelines </mark>
    - Clear Problem Statement
    - Must content a specific set of instructions
    - Steps must be clear without subtasks
    - We need a result
    - Algorithm should complete and not take infinite amount of time 
    - Consistent results for the same amount of values defines if algorithm is correct 
    - Linear Search
        - From 1 - end number
        - Implemented in real life 
    - Binary Search     
        - Take the half of all the elements and start comparing to the target
        - log of n + 1 
    - Correctness 
        - Input - <mark>Problem</mark> - Output
        - For any possible input the algorithm should always terminate or end
    - Efficiency 
        - Time and space
            - the less time you need the more efficient you are 
            - shouldn't consume too much space 
            - analysing the worst case scenario is useful
    - Big O 
        - Theoretiral definition of the complexity of an algorith as a function
        - O (n) - measures how the algorithm performs in the worse case scenario 
    - <mark> Logarithmic Runtime </mark>
    - <mark> Polynomial Runtimes </mark>
        - efficient 
    - <mark> exponential runtimes </mark>
        - n increases slightly and the number of operations raises fast
        - brute forcing
        - traveling salesman
